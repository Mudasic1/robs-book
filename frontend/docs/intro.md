# Introduction to Physical AI

<PersonalizeButton chapterId="intro" />
<TranslateButton chapterId="intro" />

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - your comprehensive guide to embodied intelligence!

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence - systems that don't just process information but interact with and understand the physical world. Unlike traditional AI confined to digital environments, Physical AI combines perception, reasoning, and action in real-world settings.

## Course Overview

This course covers four essential modules:

### 🤖 Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

Learn the middleware that powers modern robots, from publishers and subscribers to complex action servers.

### 🎮 Module 2: Simulation with Gazebo & Unity

Master physics simulation and create digital twins of your robots before deploying to hardware.

### 🚀 Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform

Explore cutting-edge AI-powered perception, navigation, and sim-to-real transfer.

### 🗣️ Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models

Integrate LLMs with robotics for natural language control and cognitive planning.

## Why This Matters

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned to excel in human environments because they share our physical form. This course prepares you to build the next generation of embodied AI systems.
