## Learning Objectives
- Understand what ROS 2 is and why it's used in humanoid robotics.
- Identify the core differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2.
- Set up a basic workspace.

## What is ROS 2?

**Robot Operating System (ROS)** is not an actual operating system, but a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.

In the context of **Humanoid Robotics**, ROS 2 acts as the "nervous system." Just as the human nervous system transmits signals between the brain and muscles, ROS 2 handles communication between the robot's high-level AI (digital brain) and its actuators/sensors (physical body).

### Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is designed for production. Unlike ROS 1, which was research-focused, ROS 2 supports:
- **Real-time systems**: Critical for balancing a humanoid robot.
- **Security**: Essential when robots operate near humans.
- **Embedded systems**: Running on smaller, more efficient chips.

## Core Concepts: Nodes and Topics

At its heart, ROS 2 is about communication.

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation. One node might control a servo motor, another might process camera images.
- **Topics**: Buses over which nodes exchange messages. A camera node publishes images to a `/camera/image` topic, which a vision node subscribes to.

## Hands-On Exercise: Your First Node

Let's write a simple Python node that "speaks" (publishes data).

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class HumanoidVoice(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('humanoid_voice')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'speech_topic', 10)
        timer_period = 2.0  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello Human #%d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    humanoid_voice = HumanoidVoice()
    rclpy.spin(humanoid_voice)
    humanoid_voice.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Summary
You've just learned the basics of ROS 2 as the nervous system for humanoid robots. In the next section, we will control a virtual robot in standard simulation.
