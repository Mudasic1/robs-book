# Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System**! In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for modern robots.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

### Why ROS 2?

- **Real-time Performance**: Built on DDS (Data Distribution Service) for deterministic communication
- **Security**: Native support for encryption and authentication
- **Multi-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Production Ready**: Used in commercial robots and autonomous vehicles

## Key Concepts

### 1. Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2. Each node is a process that performs computation.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_node')
        self.get_logger().info('Hello from ROS 2!')

def main():
    rclpy.init()
    node = MinimalNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

### 2. Topics

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They implement publish-subscribe communication.

### 3. Services

Services provide synchronous request-reply communication between nodes.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:

- ✅ Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- ✅ Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
- ✅ Implement communication using topics and services
- ✅ Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`
- ✅ Work with URDF for humanoid robot description

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

## Installation

Before starting, ensure you have ROS 2 installed. We recommend **ROS 2 Humble** for this course.

```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
