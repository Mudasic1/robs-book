# Services and Actions

<div style={{ display: 'flex', marginBottom: '20px' }}>

## Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between synchronous (Services) and asynchronous (Actions) calls.
- Implement an Inverse Kinematics service.

## Services: Ask and Wait

Topics are for continuous data (streaming). **Services** are for "Call and Response."
Analogy: 
- Topic: Radio broadcast (listen if you want).
- Service: Ordering pizza (you ask, you wait for confirmation).

### Example: Inverse Kinematics
A humanoid arm needs to calculate joint angles to reach a point. This is a computation request.

```python
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class IKService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('ik_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'compute_ik', self.compute_callback)

    def compute_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b # Placeholder for complex math
        self.get_logger().info('Incoming request')
        return response
```

## Actions: Long-Running Tasks

Walking to a goal takes time. You don't want to block the thread waiting for 10 seconds.
**Actions** allow you to:
1. Send a goal (Walk forward 5 meters).
2. Get feedback (Walked 1 meter... 2 meters...).
3. Get result (Arrived!).
4. Cancel if needed (Stop!!).

## Summary
- Use **Topics** for sensor data.
- Use **Services** for quick computations/queries.
- Use **Actions** for behaviors (walking, grasping).
