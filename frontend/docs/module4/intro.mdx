# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action**! This is where AI meets robotics - the convergence of Large Language Models and physical robot control.

## What is VLA?

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models combine:

- **Vision**: Understanding the visual world through cameras
- **Language**: Natural language understanding and generation
- **Action**: Translating understanding into robot movements

## The VLA Pipeline

```
Voice Command → Speech-to-Text → LLM Planning → Action Sequence → Robot Execution
```

### Example Flow

1. **User**: "Clean the room"
2. **Whisper**: Transcribes to text
3. **LLM**: Plans sequence: [navigate, detect_objects, pick, place]
4. **ROS 2**: Executes actions on robot
5. **Vision**: Confirms task completion

## Why VLA Matters

- **Natural Interaction**: Talk to robots like humans
- **Flexible Behavior**: No need to pre-program every task
- **Adaptive**: Robots can handle novel situations
- **Accessible**: Non-experts can command robots

## What You'll Learn

- ✅ Integrate OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- ✅ Use LLMs for cognitive planning
- ✅ Translate language to ROS 2 actions
- ✅ Build a complete autonomous humanoid system
- ✅ Complete the capstone project

## Technologies We'll Use

### Speech Recognition

- **OpenAI Whisper**: State-of-the-art speech-to-text
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency transcription

### Language Models

- **GPT-4**: For complex reasoning and planning
- **LangChain**: For structured LLM workflows
- **Function Calling**: Direct action execution

### Robot Control

- **ROS 2 Actions**: Long-running tasks
- **MoveIt 2**: Motion planning
- **Nav2**: Navigation stack

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of LLMs and prompting
- Python async programming
- ROS 2 action servers

## Installation

```bash
# Install Whisper
pip install openai-whisper

# Install LangChain
pip install langchain openai

# Install ROS 2 dependencies
sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
```
