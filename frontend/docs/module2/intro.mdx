# Module 2: The Digital Twin

Welcome to **Module 2: The Digital Twin**! In this module, you'll learn how to create realistic simulations of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that behaves identically to its real-world counterpart. It allows you to:

- Test algorithms safely before deploying to hardware
- Generate synthetic training data for AI models
- Visualize robot behavior in real-time
- Simulate dangerous or expensive scenarios

## Why Use Simulation?

### Benefits

- **Safety**: Test without risking expensive hardware
- **Speed**: Iterate faster than real-world testing
- **Scale**: Run multiple simulations in parallel
- **Data Generation**: Create unlimited training scenarios

### Tools We'll Use

#### Gazebo

- **Physics Engine**: Realistic gravity, friction, collisions
- **Sensor Simulation**: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Native support for ROS topics/services
- **Best For**: Physics-accurate testing

#### Unity

- **High-Fidelity Graphics**: Photorealistic rendering
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Simulate people and environments
- **ML-Agents**: Built-in reinforcement learning
- **Best For**: Visual AI training and HRI

## What You'll Learn

- ✅ Set up Gazebo for humanoid simulation
- ✅ Create realistic physics environments
- ✅ Integrate Unity with ROS 2
- ✅ Simulate sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- ✅ Generate synthetic data for AI training

## Prerequisites

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 basics)
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Familiarity with URDF

## Installation

### Gazebo

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
```

### Unity (with ROS-TCP-Connector)

```bash
# Install Unity Hub
# Download Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
# Install ROS-TCP-Connector package in Unity
```

## Next Steps

Let's start with [Gazebo Simulation](./gazebo-simulation.mdx)!
